Today is the day I started working on Tuba Knight. First of all, I'd
love to give a thank you to Brayden (aka GDcheerios) for inspiring me to
make this, as I was really compelled by his "Gentry's Quest" project to
make something of the same caliber. Really impressive stuff, and it's alot
of fun.

This project takes inspiration from a couple of different things in
regards to its gameplay.
First, obviously, the "Tuba Knight" is a reference to the meme rabbit hole
you can find all over YouTube. Generally, this meme involves people making
boss/character themes for a game called Tuba Knight that doesn't actually exist.
It's a pretty good bit in my opinion, although I'm far from the first person to
have the idea of actually making it into a game, and even though this project isn't
as impressive as some attempts I've seen for this idea, I just want to make something
I'm personally proud of. Additionally, if I end up somehow attaching music to this
project in the future, it will likely be inspired by these memes.

Second, I'd like to make it similar in gameplay to "West of Loathing" by Asymmetric
Publications. The game is extremely funny, creative, and fun. Overall, I'd say it's a
masterclass on how to make a player care about the world of a game. From the ability
to personalize your character, horse, pardner, gear, and even the decisions you make,
every playthrough feels special, different, and even playing the game dozens of times
isn't enough to discover all it has to offer. Because I plan on making this an ongoing
project, I'm going to implement all the underlying systems first, and then slowly expand
the world more and more, until I feel like it is complete.

Finally, the gameplay is meant to feel like a JRPG (Japanese Role-Playing Game), which
from my experience means an RPG involving stats and equipment, turn-based combat, leveling,
party members, and much more. Even though this is the first thing I'm writing for this
project, I'll probably end up making a "research" file or something along those lines
where I document all my exact sources of inspiration after doing a bit of research, and I'll
go more in depth there on what elements of gameplay I'll be using.

While I tried to jump straight into development yesterday, I quickly discovered I needed to
do a bit more research and make a clear strategy on how I wanted to create this project.

To accomplish this, I mostly took the day off of writing code and put my time towards planning
this project out, at least in my head. Not really a "plan," so much as the order to build this
project in. Helping me out in this ordering was Brayden, the one who inspired me to make
this in the first place. I took some time to study Gentry's Quest, as it is completely open source.
The link to Brayden's GitHub, and thus the source code for Gentry's Quest, is in the sources file.

Today I got work done on so many different things, it's not really worth talking about. The most
I can say is to take a look at the changelog.

However, there's still alot to be done. All that I truly finished today was loading and saving, and
even that still needs work before it is complete. The only reason I'm calling it "finished" is
because I dont have time today to do everything I need to with Items and Item IDs, and to be
honest, I'd like to take a break from this today. I'm still very excited to continue working on
this, and it's hard to stop working right here with so much to do, but with other responsibilities
I have to tend to, it's just not happening today. That said, I want to make a checklist of what I
want to accomplish tomorrow:

First, like I said, I want to work on Items and Item IDs. This is because equipped Items get
written into a player-character's PlayerData file, and I this is my top priority. Play testing
other parts of the game will be significantly easier if I can load a test player and give it
arbitrary Items. Additionally, it means I won't have to keep hardcoding the information that
the program writes into these playerData files, like it does currently.

Second, I want to at least start TubaKnight.play(). Again, play testing will be significantly
easier if I can just hop straight into a game to test out new functionality, such as
battling (whenever that happens).

And for now, those are the big two. If I have more time tomorrow and I was able to get both of
those done, I'd like to finish up the UI stuff as much as I can. I want to save all the really
fun game design for later, such as making items and enemies, and although making the UI isn't
boring per se, it certainly doesn't pack the same punch. Besides, I want to stop looking at basic
terminal text if I can help it, and because I plan to make the UI at least somewhat interesting,
it'll help me enjoy more of the project down the road by not constantly being in front of such
bland screens.

Did not work much on the project today, since I was busy flying home for Thanksgiving. Will
make progress tomorrow.
===================================================================================================
11-24-2024
Today I was able to make good progress on what I wanted to get accomplished yesterday. Items
and ItemLists now have functioning __repr__(), allowing for the saving method of TubaKnight.py
to be fully functional. I haven't actually finished its implementation, but I'll be getting to
that soon. For now, I want to make sure that Items are behaving how they should and I have all
the __repr__ methods for everything that needs them. After that gets finished, I'll complete
the saving method of TubaKnight.py, and then move on to Areas. I want to create a special test
Area and get the actual gameplay loop working inside of it, which will probably one o the biggest
parts of this project.
===================================================================================================
11-26-2024
Today I fully finished the saving functionality, apart from the Area writing, which I will of
course handle whenever I write the code to create Areas. This will probably be my next course
of action. After that, I'd like to start coding the act() methods for various entities like
enemies and items. That said, to test these things, I'll also need to get the battle system up.
If only there wasn't so much to do.

I need to plan out the different actions the player can take from the main menu so that I can get
started on actually making the game interactable.
Here are some starter things I can think of-

-Continue Story
-Wander
-Items (interacting with your equipped items and inventory items)
-Settings
    -Albums (Compilations of discovered gameplay elements)
        -Bestiary         (NPCs)
        -Item Manual      (Items)
        -Travel Brochures (Regions)
    -How to Play
    -Credits
-Save
-Quit

I'll build upon this whenever I actually start work on it.

I'm currently not able to work on this every day, since it's Thanksgiving break right now and I
can't dedicate a ton of time to sitting alone in my room coding. Even then, I have assignments
and the Crossword Project to work on when I do code, so this is more of a "when-I-have-time-to"
thing right now. Hopefully, come the new year, I'll be able to spend more time on this.
===================================================================================================

Started work on some of the simpler steps towards my end goal, which is getting Areas
implemented. As I started to work, I realized all I had right now was PlayerData, not an actual
player. So I started there, and edited some past files to account for the new standards I wanted
for all entities, not just players.
