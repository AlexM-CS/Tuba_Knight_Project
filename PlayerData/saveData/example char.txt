This file is meant to serve as an example for how playerData objects are formatted.
playerData objects are updated accordingly during gameplay. Text files are used to
store data between saves.

Line 1 will always be written as:
"PlayerData_playerName", where playerName is the name of the current player.

Line 2 will always be written in the format given above, beginning with "Stats_".
This information will be used to create a Stats object for the player-character.
Following the "Stats_" text is several stats and a corresponding 4-digit hexadecimal value.
These stats are what could be called "base stats" for a character, and are independent
of any equipped items, buffs, etc. The base stats are the only thing saved in a character's
playerData file. Anything that provides additional stats will be considered "temporary stats"
and will be added during calculations, but not outside of battles.
Every stat is represented by a three-letter string. These strings stand for the following:
LVL: Level
EXP: Experience
HPS: Hit Points/Health/HP
MPS: Magic Points/Magic/MP
STR: Strength
DEX: Dexterity
MGC: Magic
DFN: Defense
SPE: Speed
CRT: Crit Chance

Line 3 will always be written in the format given above, beginning with "RegionID_".
This ID will tell the game what Area object to create, and subsequently, to place the
player in. These IDs are always a 2-digit hexadecimal value.

Line 4 indicates that all other lines are items that the program must read in.

The format for reading in items is given above. "HELD_" and "ITM1-5_" indicate that the item
in question is equipped. In the case of "HELD_", that item is the player's weapon, and in
the case of "ITM1-5_", the given item is equipped in the given item slot. All other items,
labeled "ITMi_", are contained within the player's inventory.

Other relevant data is gathered while the game is played. For example, quest progress, either
for the main story or a side quest, is only updated when relevant. If the player does not involve
themselves in the main story or any given side quest while playing, that Quest object will remain
unloaded. If the player does interact with the main quest while playing, the Quest will be
created and its data loaded until the player saves again.
